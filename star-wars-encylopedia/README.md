# StarWarsEncylopedia

Less of an encylopedia and more of a star wars character search portal...

It is supposed to be a contact list which you can search.

I focussed on getting limited functionality working well and solidly tested.

You can search for characters by name and then navigate to a detail view

Alternatively, if you know the id of a specific character, you can deep link.

E.G. `http://localhost:4200/contact/1`

`npm install` to install the project

`npm run start` to run it. It will be available at http://localhost:4200

`npm run test` to run the tests
